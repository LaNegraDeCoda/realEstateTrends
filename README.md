# 🏠 Real Estate Transaction Trends API Integration

This project connects to the [ATTOM Data API](https://developer.attomdata.com/) to retrieve **real estate transaction trends** for a specific ZIP code, including:

- 📅 Yearly home sale volume (count)
- 💰 Average sale price
- 📊 Median sale price

Currently, this tool is set up to fetch data for one ZIP code (`48317`) for the years 2018–2022.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Express backend connects to ATTOM’s Sales Trend endpoint.
- Uses a fixed `geoId` tied to a ZIP code.
- Returns JSON formatted yearly housing market stats.

Example API Call:
GET http://localhost:3000/transaction?zip=48317

Example Response:
```json
[
  {
    "year": "2022",
    "homeSaleCount": 375,
    "avgSalePrice": 272768,
    "medSalePrice": 251000
  },
  ...
]
